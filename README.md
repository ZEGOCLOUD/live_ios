# ZEGOCLOUD Live

ZEGO Live is a one-stop product that you can use to build interactive live streaming experiences. You can create single-host, multi-host live streaming sessions with audio effects, face beautification, and more features provided by ZEGOCLOUD.

With ZEGO Live, users can create a live room to host, watch live video streaming events, invite participants in the live room to co-host, and more. Participants can send text messages to interact with the host and co-hosts in real time.

ZEGO Live can cover typical scenarios include live video streaming, live online classes, live-stream shopping/e-commerce, or live game streaming.
